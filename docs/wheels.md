# Wheels

We have compiled over 150 wheels for riscv in a [pip index](https://think-and-dev.github.io/riscv-python-wheels/pip-index/). Within a RISC-V architecture, you can easily install any library by specifying its name and version in a `requirements.txt` file, and then executing the command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://think-and-dev.github.io/riscv-python-wheels/pip-index/
```

Find the instructions to compile your own Python wheels in the [Python riscv64 wheels builder](https://github.com/Think-and-Dev/riscv-python-wheels) repository.
