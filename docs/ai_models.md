# AI models

The Dapp Whistleblower uses two different models for image processing: YOLO, an object detection model, and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model.

## Licence plate detection (YOLOX)

For object detection we use [YOLOX](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX), an improved version of the YOLO architecture that addresses previous limitations. We implement the YOLOX-Nano variant, designed to be more efficient and lightweight.

## Character recognition
